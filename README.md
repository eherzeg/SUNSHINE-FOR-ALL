SUNSHINE FOR ALL

Through a mobile solution (app) we intend to facilitate access to scientific data stored by NASA related to solar irradiation in a more user-friendly and understandable way.
With simple screens and little interaction required, it will be possible to obtain reliable data and information (forecasts through AI) that can help users in the decision-making process in solar energy generation projects, thus democratizing and enabling the execution of projects.
Our solution is important because we think about equity for people and companies with an interest in solar energy, and this can make data access fairer.
